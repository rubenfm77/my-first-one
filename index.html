            <p>My name is Ruben and in this section I wanted to give you a little professional info on myself.</p>
            <p>I'm a Law and Human Resources specialist, that has been working last few years in data analysis for an Spanish bank.  Now I'm learning web programming, but I'm till far away from the level I want to reach, as you can see.</p>
            <p>Please, have mercy on my soul.</p>

            <p>I'm passionate about many things, but specially cycling. Dolomites is a unique place where biggest battles in the history of cycling took place. It's a unique and stunning place that you must visite if you are a cycling aficionado or just if you love nature and mountains.</p>
            <p>Wheter you decide to travel with your car, your motorbike or your bicycle, you won't be dissapointed. High mountain passes, twisted hairpins like the Stelvio, rocks with magic shapes and forms will make you to want to come back.</P>
